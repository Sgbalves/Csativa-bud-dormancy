Scripts used for RNA-seq and EM-seq analysis

In this repository are available the R scripts used for RNA-seq analysis using the DESeq2, as well as scripts used for methylation analysis using the methylKit package. At the time of the analysis some files were processed in Microsoft excel before reloading them back to R, in such cases an alternative full R methodology is refered, which produces the same results without the need of extracting the files/data.frames.

The scripts available here are a unified version of multiple scripts files to try provide the complete analysis from the first setps to the final results.
